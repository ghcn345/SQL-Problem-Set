## Assessment Test 3

- 1. Create a new database called "School" this database should have two tables: teachers and students. The students table should have columns for student_id, first_name,last_name, homeroom_number, phone,email, and graduation year. 
```sql
CREATE TABLE students(
student_id serial PRIMARY KEY,
first_name VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,
last_name VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL, 
homeroom_number integer,
phone VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
email VARCHAR(115) UNIQUE,
grad_year integer);
```


- 2. The teachers table should have columns for teacher_id, first_name, last_name, homeroom_number, department, email, and phone. The constraints are mostly up to you, but your table constraints do have to consider the following: We must have a phone number to contact students in case of an emergency; We must have ids as the primary key of the tables; Phone numbers and emails must be unique to the individual. 
```sql
CREATE TABLE teachers(
teacher_id serial PRIMARY KEY,
first_name VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,
last_name VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL, 
homeroom_number integer,
department VARCHAR(45),
email VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE,
phone VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE);
```


- 3. Once you've made the tables, insert a student named Mark Watney (student_id=1) who has a phone number of 777-555-1234 and doesn't have an email. He graduates in 2035 and has 5 as a homeroom number. 
```sql
INSERT INTO students(first_name,last_name, homeroom_number,phone,grad_year)VALUES ('Mark','Watney',5,'7755551234',2035);
```


- 4. Then insert a teacher names Jonas Salk (teacher_id = 1) who as a homeroom number of 5 and is from the Biology department. His contact info is: jsalk@school.org and a phone number of 777-555-4321.
```sql
INSERT INTO teachers(first_name,last_name, homeroom_number,department,email,phone)VALUES ('Jonas','Salk',5,'Biology','jsalk@school.org','7755554321');
```


## Assessment Test 4

- 1. Write a query that retrieves suppliers that work in either Georgia or California.
```sql
SELECT * FROM suppliers
WHERE state = 'Georgia' OR state = 'California';
```

- 2. Write a query that retrieves suppliers with the characters "wo" and the character "I" or "i" in their name.
```sql
SELECT * FROM suppliers
WHERE supplier_name like '%wo%' AND (supplier_name like '%i%' OR supplier_name like '%I%');
```

- 3. Write a query that retrieves suppliers on which a minimum of 37,000 and a maximum of 80,000 was spent. You may also use the BETWEEN operator to solve this problem.
```sql
SELECT * FROM suppliers
WHERE total_spent >= 37000 AND total_spent <= 80000;
```

- 4. Write a query that returns the supplier names and the state in which they operate meeting the following conditions: belong in the state Georgia or Alaska, the supplier id is 100 or greater than 600, the amount spent is less than 100,000 or the amount spent is 220,000.
```sql
SELECT supplier_name, state FROM suppliers
WHERE state IN ('Georgia', 'Alaska') AND (supplier_id = 100 OR supplier_id > 600) AND (total_spent < 100000 OR total_spent = 220000);
```


## Assessment Test 5

- 1. Considering the data exists in the city table, write a query that will return records similar to what is shown below for those cities that have the COUNTRYCODE of 'cbd' : "NEW YORK CITY has the population of 8,500,000", "LOS ANGELES has the population of 632,000". Note: I'd like you to use functions in the SELECT statement to solve this problem.
```sql
SELECT CONCAT(CONCAT(UPPER(name), ' has the population of '), population)
FROM city
WHERE LOWER(countrycode) = 'cbd';
```


- 2. Write a query that would show the first three letters and the last three letters of the DISTRICT capitalized and separated by a dash. Note: I'd like you to use functions in the SELECT statement to solve this problem.
```sql
SELECT CONCAT(CONCAT(UPPER(SUBSTR(district, 1, 3)), ' - '), UPPER(SUBSTR(district, LENGTH(district)-2)))
FROM city;
```

## Assessment Test 6

- 1. [The Report](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/the-report/problem?isFullScreen=true): You are given two tables: Students and Grades. Students contains three columns ID, Name and Marks. Ketty gives Eve a task to generate a report containing three columns: Name, Grade and Mark. Ketty doesn't want the NAMES of those students who received a grade lower than 8. The report must be in descending order by grade -- i.e. higher grades are entered first. If there is more than one student with the same grade (8-10) assigned to them, order those particular students by their name alphabetically. Finally, if the grade is lower than 8, use "NULL" as their name and list them by their grades in descending order. If there is more than one student with the same grade (1-7) assigned to them, order those particular students by their marks in ascending order. Write a query to help Eve.
```sql
SELECT IF(Grade > 7, Name, NULL), Grade, Marks
FROM Students 
JOIN Grades
WHERE Marks BETWEEN Min_Mark AND Max_Mark
ORDER BY Grade DESC, Name;
```
OR
```sql
SELECT CASE WHEN G.Grade > 7 THEN S.Name ELSE 'NULL' END AS Name, G.Grade, S.Marks
FROM Students S
JOIN Grades G 
ON S.Marks BETWEEN G.Min_Mark AND G.Max_Mark
ORDER BY G.Grade DESC, Name;
```
